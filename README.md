# SegmentTree-Library
This is a segment tree library which works for different data types and different operations on a vector for e.g. minimum, maximum in a given range or sum of values in a given range.
In order to use this library in our C++ code, we must firslty include the segment tree library in our file. We must specify the following things to work with the segment tree i.e."
-> data type
-> vector
-> operation function viz. minimum, maximum, sum, etc.
